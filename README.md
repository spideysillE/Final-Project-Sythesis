# Final-Project-Sythesis
My Final project for fall semester of 2017

My accumulation of everything I have learned from coding. I greatly enjoyed the research and development that went into learning the use of HTML5 and P5.JS and the application of both of those programming languages. There are some initial design flaws in my website, due to the use of bootstrap and traditional css files, but overall it turned out alright. There was difficulty implementing all the different aspects of the webpage, and making is easily accessible to all media outlets. The P5.js program was displayed outside of my body tags which was a problem, but once fixed would lead to an adequately designed website. The color scheme was a bit of trial and error, but eventually I found something that worked for both practical reasons and for visual pleasing margins. To top it off, I had never coded or programmed before I came to college so this is a trial run in both of these areas, and my first time testing the waters in this field. I enjoy the challenges that come along with formatting, and the initial coding I really had a fun time with. I hope to improve this website in the future, and look forward to making new ones.
